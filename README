The class string_match_score includes a constructor, 3 datamembers & 4 functions.
Data members:
*str1 
*str2 (the strings whose match score is to be found)
*match_score

Functions:
**get_input()
  This function is used to assign values to str1 &str2 taking from the user through console (for part1 of the assignment)
**input_from_file(s1,s2)
  This function is also used to assign values to str1 & str2 but by reading the strings though the files whose names are obtained as command line 
  arguments.(for part2 of assignment)
**evaluate_edit_distance(s1,s2)
  Evaluates edit distance between any two strings s1,s2 & returns it.
**evaluate_match_score()
  Evaluates the match score between the data members of the class str1 & str2.
  THis consists of first finding the substrings of both the strings and them the edit distance between each pair obtained.
  THe match score of the strings is then the total number of subtring pairs which had edit distance<=3
  
  
*******match_score.py****************

Imports the python_header file.
Takes the input strings from the user by calling the get_input function of the string_match_score class and evaluates the match score between them
and prints it on the console.

*******file_string_ms.py************

Imports the python_header file.
Takes two file names as command line arguments.
If they don't exist gives an error..but if they do , then
Reads the first string of the first file and for each string obtained from the second file (newline separated),computes the match score between them.
It then outputs the line number(s) of the second file which had the highest match score.
